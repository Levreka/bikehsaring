#Analysis

#overview: 

We were ask to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We will achieve this by showing visualize data using Tableu visualization while running a small code in the background to clear our data.

#Results: 

We learned a lot by visualizing the data using tableau one of the so many factors was that males seem to typically use the bikesharing system more than their counter part. We saw this both in the check out times by gender and in trips by Gender during weekdays. We also saw the trip duration does play a part on number of bikes used. The longer the tripduration the less bikes were used. This is probably due to longer trips mean longer distances.

#Additional Visualizations:

We can perhaps see how weather affects bikesharing and see how that affects our number of bikes being used or the tripduration. Although this will probably required to combine different data sets either on tableau or using pandas to create one data frame. Another visualization can be run to see how price affects tripduration and or bikes being used.
